            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            I am a Sophomore Computer Science Undergraduate at University of Central Florida. I'm currently interning at Limbitless 
            Solutions on the Computer Science and Web Development team. I first got into computers in 2020, when I researched and built my own gaming computer
            from scratch. From there, I played around with different programming languages like Python and Java, and started coding my own projects.
            This led to my love of computers and programming and is why I decided to pursue Computer Science for my Bachelor's degree.

                I worked with a group to help decide the parts that would go along with the drone.<span id="dots2">...</span> <span id="more2"> I helped to mix the AI and algorithm smoothly.
                We designed our own AI program and Machine Learning Model to track a given target with the drone without getting lost or damaged. 
                This meant the drone was able to detect objects around it and manuever around them as well as track and film the given target at
                a safe distance. We utilized Python, C++, Verilog, TensorFlow, Numpy, Pillow, OpenCV and GitHub.</span>
